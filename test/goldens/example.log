Create a json structure
Add hashes to the json structure.
{
  "a": "0",
  "b": "1",
  "child": {
    "d": 3,
    "e": 4,
    "_hash": "nfTEHYDoqVPb3ieJSmBxft"
  },
  "_hash": "k-3v5I-Q6Q9vPdVJxsMYUk"
}
Set a maximum floating point precision.
Number 1.0000000001 has a higher precision than 0.001.
Use hash to modify the input object directly.
Set "upateExistingHashes: false" to create missing hashes but without touching existing ones.
If existing hashes do not match new ones, an error is thrown.
Hash "invalid" does not match the newly calculated one "AVq9f1zFei3ZS3WQ8ErYCE". Please make sure that all systems are producing the same hashes.
Set "throwOnWrongHashes" to false to replace invalid hashes.
invalid
Use validate to check if the hashes are correct
Hash "invalid" is wrong. Should be "cHeM4BrY0agsgKNQC-5Hbz".
